This game is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. \n\
\n\ The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row,
        and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions")
        contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid,
        which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
